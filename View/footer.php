            <p class="light">When you think of the spring, you think of the warm sun, all of the people frolicking, makes you think about how great of a time it is to live in right! Sadness and the reciprocation of sadness only beings more sadness, the only thing that can solve the world's problems is love and empathy!</p>

            <p class="light">Why waste all of the spring goodness, fun and kindness with yourself when you can promote a better environment, in the spring and not, when you reciprocate the warm attitudes to those around you! You can only solve hate and sadness with kindness and empathy!</p>
